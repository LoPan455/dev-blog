## Who Is Thomas Johander?

As a technology professional with over 10 years of experience in networking, Voice over IP (VoIP), Windows server management, desktop support and software engineering, I've been exposed to so many aspects of the tech industry. Most recently, I worked with a talented team at a Fortune 30 retailer, focused on a tech-stack that included:

* Spring Boot
* Kotlin
* Groovy
* Spock Testing Framework
* Gradle
* Spring Web Flux
* MongoDB
* Kafka
* Elasticsearch

## Why I Created This Blog

I came to coding by way of a (amazing) Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp.  I had exposure to exactly 1 element in the above list during my software engineer training: MongoDB. 
Everything that I've learned about my current tech-stack has been on-the-job and just enough to finish the task at hand.  I wanted to create a place where I could tinker, explore, learn and _have fun doing it_.
Teaching something is the highest form of understanding and this blog provides a place that I get to teach what I learn.

## How Did I Get Here?

I've been a software developer for several years, but my career in Tech didn't start that way.

Working as a technical staff member at a Managed Services consultancy for several years, I really enjoyed what I did every day.  
Managing customers' desktop support needs, some "beginner" Windows Server administration duties, and the general grab-bag of random things that come across one's desk as Desktop Support agent,
I loved learning new things and mastering these machines that I found so fascinating.

My company had great opportunities to grow into larger roles. Moving from Desktop Support into a role on our Sales Engineering team, I got to help conduct sales demos and national road-show tour showcasing the company's crown jewel piece of intellectual property it developed: an integration of 
Microsoft Business Productivity tools like SharePoint and Dynamics CRM with a contact center platform built by Interactive Intelligence (now part of the Genesys). As my experience with contact center technology increased, I moved into a technical role supporting an enterprise customer's contact center platform. Digging deep into this large application and applying the myriad technical skills I had developed over the previous few years, I had a deep sense of satisfaction with my career.
It was a period of my career that was exciting, stressful and challenging.  

As time went on, though, I started to wonder what other opportunities might be out there.  I liked what I did, but could there be more ways to grow and learn?  As I began to explore other opportunities in the tech world, I kept bumping into a simple truth: for every opportunity that used the skills I had built, there were ten more that involved software development.

I never thought I could be developer; phrases like this would always immediately follow thinking about learning to build software:

* _"I'm terrible at math."_
* _"I don't think my mind works like a developer."_
* _"It seems too hard, I can't possibly have what it takes to succeed."_

Faced with becoming more and more specialized in a role that would really limit my future options, I decided to take a risk.

I spent weeks weighing out the best way to re-tool my career into Software Engineering and decided to enroll in a
full-stack software engineering bootcamp program.  After several months of very hard work, I graduated and landed
my first developer role working on a marketing platform run on the LAMP Stack with an AngularJS front-end.

Thanks to a lot of guidance and support from my team I took my first steps into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),
DevOps and Version Control Systems.  It was hard work; sometimes exciting and energizing, other times confusing and frustrating.
It was the perfect first developer job, though.  I had a great team; we all learned so much from each other.

After grinding out those long months of being a junior developer, an opportunity came up to join an enterprise team in a huge organization.  I was thrilled to land the job in such a large organization.  I'd have a change to see what the "big boys" did.  As it turned out, it really wasn't much different from what the previous 18 months had been like! Sure the tech stack was a bit more advanced, but the practices of good software engineering that I learned at my first job were 100% applicable to this new role.

It's been a few years since I made that jump, and I've learned a staggering amount about how software is made, how it's maintained, how it breaks and how people use it.  I am so grateful to everyone that has mentored and guided me through some very challenging work.  I hope this blog serves as a resource for others on their learning journey.
