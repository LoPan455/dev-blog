I've been a software developer for several years.  After working as a technical staff member a Managed Services consultancy for several years, I decided that it was time to take on a new challenge.

I spent months weighing out the best way to re-tool my career into Software Engineering and decided to enroll in a 
full-stack software engineering bootcamp program.  After several months of very hard work, I graduated and landed 
my first developer role working on a marketing platform run on the LAMP Stack with an AngularJS front-end.

Thanks to a lot of guidance and support from my team I took my first steps into Object Oriented Programming,
DevOps, Version Control Systems.  It was hard work; sometimes exciting and energizing, other times confusing frustrating.
It was the perfect first developer job, though.  I was introduced to tools, architecture and patterns I use still today
in the Fortune 50 enterprise in which I now work.
